# `<project>` Charter

> **What we have figured out so far.** Present tense: the things that are settled about the game,
> and the constraints that settled them. A contested proposal is checked against section 2 first.
>
> Companion documents: [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](./OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) is what we still have to find
> out. [`DESIGN-LOG.md`](./DESIGN-LOG.md) is what we tried and what happened. How we work is in
> [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
>
> Nothing here describes the game's code, and that is deliberate. A charter that describes the code
> goes out of date the first time the code changes, and once readers know one section is out of
> date, they stop trusting the important ones along with it.

*This file arrived as a template. Italic text is a prompt to you; anything in angle brackets is a
placeholder. Answer a prompt and delete it. A section you cannot fill in is not a blank to leave
sitting here — it is an entry for [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](./OPEN-QUESTIONS.md).*

## 1. What `<project>` is

*One paragraph. The premise, the genre, and how faithful it is to anything it recreates or draws on.
Concrete enough that a stranger could picture a minute of play. If it needs a second paragraph, it
is not settled yet — write down the part that is and file the rest as an open question.*

*Then the founding commitments: the one, two, or three things that were true before anything else
was decided, and that everything downstream is an attempt to satisfy at once. Name them. Most of
the interesting design work on a game is the tension between its commitments, and you cannot
recognize that work while it is happening unless the commitments are written down.*

**`<Commitment>`.** *`<What it means, and what feeling it is chasing. A commitment that cannot be
contradicted is not one — say what it costs you.>`*

### What a play session is

*The loop, in the second person, in five or six sentences: what the player does, in what order, and
what they come back with. Then the shape of time — how long one play session runs, and what many of
them add up to.*

---

## 2. What it has to be

*Three to five criteria, concrete enough to reject a proposal. When something is contested, it
settles here first.*

*The useful half of each is what it rules out. A criterion that rejects nothing is a mood, and a
mood cannot settle an argument. Write the "rules out" line first if it helps: if you cannot name
anything it kills, the criterion is not real yet.*

**`<Criterion>`.** *`<What it means for the player, in one or two sentences.>`*

*Rules out:* *`<The specific proposals this criterion kills, named. Include the expensive ones —
the cost is what makes it a criterion rather than a preference.>`*

## 3. Guidelines for the whole game

A guideline here serves the game that sections 1 and 2 describe. When one pulls against a criterion
in section 2, neither outranks the other: talk it through, case by case. Sometimes the vision is
what matters, and the guideline gives way. Sometimes the pull points at a gap in the outline or the
goals, and that goes to [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](./OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) as a collision, to be worked on.

*Only guidelines that hold across the whole game go here: the criteria above are about what the
game is, and a guideline that governs one system lives with that system, down in section 4.*

*Each guideline states its why, so that when it is inconvenient, the argument starts from its reason
instead of from scratch. Where a guideline has an operational test — some question that is easier
to apply than the guideline itself — write that down too. The test is the part that actually gets
used.*

**`<Guideline, stated as an imperative or a flat assertion.>`**
*`<What it asks for or rules out, in one or two sentences.>`*

*Why:* *`<The failure it exists to prevent, and the operational test if there is one.>`*

---

## 4. The building blocks

*One block per system large enough that a decision about it constrains other systems (movement, say,
or combat, or the economy). Expect somewhere between four and eight. More than that and some of them
are features rather than blocks.*

*Each block states the problem it exists to solve before it states the answer, under these
headings, in this order. The problem statement is the part that gets skipped and the part worth the
most later: it is how a reader six months from now can tell whether a proposed change is a better
answer or a different question.*

*None of them describes the code. Keep it that way — see the note at the top of this file.*

### 4.1 `<Block name>`

**The problem.** *`<What this exists to solve, and the constraints sections 2 and 3 have already
placed on the answer.>`*

**The shape.** *`<The answer, in terms of what the player encounters and why that satisfies the
problem. Behaviour and consequence, never mechanism.>`*

**What we learned.** *`<What playing or building it taught, once there is anything to say. Leave
this heading out until then rather than filling it with intentions.>`*

### 4.2 `<Block name>`

*`<Same three headings. Add blocks as systems earn them; a block with nothing under "The problem"
is a feature that wandered in.>`*
